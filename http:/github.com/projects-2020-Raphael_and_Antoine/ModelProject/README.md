                              *** MODEL ANALYSIS PROJECT ***

In this project we tried to solve a microeconomics model with a two-input based production function (Capital and Labour). 

The Labour and Capital (K,L), are affected by the rental rate of capital (r) and the wage rate (w) 

We solved it using model analysis methods and algorythms. 

We displayed the results using graphics and Prensented results using Latex printing method for a clear
reading.

In the first part we will answer the question: 

** What is the cost-minimizing capital-to-labor ratio? ** 

We  will answer this using the MRS and substitution technique

Then we will tackle this project from a costs perspective



        Have a nice time going through our project :)
