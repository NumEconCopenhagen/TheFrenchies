
Data analysis project

Our project is titled Football Home Advantage.
It is about verifying if, during a football game, the home team really has an advantage over the visiting team, and if that has always been the case over the years.

The results of the project can be seen from running dataproject.ipynb.

This loades two datasets:
-Dataprojects.xslx
-DataProjects1.xslx

Dependencies: 
These two Datasets are collecting all the Ligue 1's games (French National Football League) from 1945 to 1954 and 2007 till 2016
These are actually two parts of the same dataset, which collect the entire games since 1945 and can be found at : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata/master/data-raw/france.csv

Enjoy!
